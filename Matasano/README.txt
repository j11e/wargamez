Here are my solutions for the first 8-problem batch of the challenge.

Just open the main.html page, all the work is done in JavaScript and the ouput sent in both the web page and the developer tools' console.

I use Jeff Mott's CryptoJS library to solve problems 7 and 8, but to make my solutions work offline, I downloaded the two necessary files: cryptojs_aes_min.js and cryptojs_ecb_mode_min.js. Source:  https://code.google.com/p/crypto-js/.
The two files:  
* http://crypto-js.googlecode.com/svn/tags/3.1.2/build/rollups/aes.js
* http://crypto-js.googlecode.com/svn/tags/3.1.2/build/components/mode-ecb-min.js
