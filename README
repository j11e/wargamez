Collection of all wargames/challenges for which I have written some code. 

These were not written for an audience: the code is messy, there are probably a lot of missings bits and pieces, and also some profanities here and there. You've been warned!

Also, don't be asses: if you found this repo because you're looking for the solutions, you're doing these challenges wrong.
